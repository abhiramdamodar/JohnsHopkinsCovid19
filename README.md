PRCP-1023: Johns Hopkins COVID-19 Prediction Project

Problem Statement
Task 1: Conduct a comprehensive data analysis report.
Task 2: Build a predictive model to forecast confirmed cases/deaths for a specific country/region based on past data.
Task 3: Provide actionable suggestions to the government health department for preparation.
Dataset Summary
Source: Johns Hopkins University (JHU) COVID-19 Data Repository.
Data Features:
RAW Version: Original dataset with metadata and cumulative totals.
CONVENIENT Version: Organized columns, daily changes, and stripped metadata.
Covers country-level confirmed cases/deaths and US county-level data.
Update Frequency: Daily at 6 AM UTC.
Deliverables
Data Analysis Report:

Visualize and analyze trends in confirmed cases and deaths.
Identify patterns and insights for different regions.
Predictive Model:

Develop and compare models (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM, Random Forest, etc.).
Forecast future cases for a selected period.
Evaluate models with metrics like MAE, RMSE, and R-squared.
Suggestions to Government:

Recommend health preparedness plans based on predictions.
Challenges Report:

Highlight issues like data missingness, inconsistencies, and modeling complexity.
Document solutions and techniques applied.
Output
Single Jupyter Notebook: Includes data analysis, predictions, model evaluations, and recommendations.
